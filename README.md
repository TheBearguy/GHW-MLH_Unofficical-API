  <img src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/yBReNVRODd4LJLVJP2iUlLQymGA.png" alt="MLH Events API">

  <p>
    This repository focuses on creating a usable API for the MLH (Major League Hacking) events page using Python.
    The goal of the project is to provide developers with a simple and efficient way to retrieve information about upcoming MLH events,
    filter events based on various criteria, and interact with event data programmatically.
    The API allows users to access event details such as event name, date, location, type, description, and registration link.
    It offers several endpoints to cater to different use cases, including retrieving all events, fetching upcoming events,
    and obtaining specific event details by its unique ID.
  </p>

  <p>
    The API does not require authentication to access the data, and its responses are provided in JSON format.
    It is designed to be easy to use and can serve as a valuable resource for developers interested in integrating MLH event data into their applications,
    websites, or tools. Whether you are planning to attend an upcoming MLH event, explore various events,
    or build something innovative with the event data, this API provides the necessary functionality to support your needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, the MLH Events API aims to facilitate the accessibility and utilization of MLH event information,
    promoting greater engagement and participation in the MLH community.
